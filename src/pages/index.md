  description: >+
    My content clearly and effectively delivers what is promised in the title of
    the project. I include visuals that reinforce, support, and communicate the
    main purpose of the content. You'll receive white papers, blog posts,
    tutorials, how-to guides, creative nonfiction, course content, and
    technology implementation support that balances empathy, information, and
    instruction to achieve results.

I discovered this while writing more than 20 books, designing and teaching several courses, blogging, and recording podcasts. My professional and personal experiences have taught me that clear effective communication is the foundation to achieving your goals. Self-publishing charted my unconventional path into STEM. Each story, website design, brand redesign, and book cover served as a guidepost that led to earning my Masters in English, Technical Communication with a concentration on empathetic digital experiences and instructional design."

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
