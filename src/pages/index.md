    My content clearly and effectively delivers what is promised in the title of
    the project. I include visuals that reinforce, support, and communicate the
    main purpose of the content. You'll receive white papers, blog posts,
    tutorials, how-to guides, creative nonfiction, course content, and
    technology implementation support that balances empathy, information, and
    instruction to achieve results.  

description: "I l\U0001F496ve creating clear effective solutions with content and design. I discovered this while writing more than 20 books, designing and teaching several courses, blogging, and recording podcasts. My professional and personal experiences have taught me that clear effective communication is the foundation to achieving your goals. Self-publishing charted my unconventional path into STEM. Each story, website design, brand redesign, and book cover served as a guidepost that led to earning my Masters in English, Technical Communication with a concentration on empathetic digital experiences and instructional design."

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
