**For me effective technical communication happens at the crossroad of human-computer interactions, design-thinking, empathetic writing, and content design. Building websites and business plans for my friends "for fun" on the weekends occupied my twenties, which led to learning the "ins and outs" of publishing books and integrated marketing communications in my early thirties. Fueled by determination, creativity, and grit I returned to college in 2013 to complete my post-secondary education which resulted in earning a Master of Arts in English, Technical Communication.**

Making words dance, sing, and play started as fun for me. Working with businesses, brands, and nonprofit organizations as a technical communicator is a dream come true, part of my purpose, passion, and work that I enjoy. Building websites evolved into creating custom fit, effective brand communication solutions for companies focused on long term efficacy based on serving the customer.

Working in customer contact positions for over twenty years across industries for fortune 500 companies as well as NGOs provided exposure to diverse customer groups. These encounters led to a deep respect for how people want to be treated. Fourteen years in integrated marketing communications afforded me the opportunity to shape the new marketing departments for established and new companies interested in authentic brand communications.

Earning my Masters of Arts in English, Technical Communications equipped me with more real-world tools to flesh out big ideas. Your organization deserves someone passionate about creating clear effective communications aligned with your objectives and valuable to your clients. Your stakeholders want someone working to not only meet but exceed expectations. You found her.
